# Calendar Render Exercise

This is a simple exercise for creating a calendar render function in javascript.

## Usage

```
$ git clone ...
$ cd calendar-render-1
$ npm run test:watch
```

The spec is implemented as a simple unit test. `test.js`

You should expected to implement the function in `index.js`.

The project is using [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) test framework.

Feel free to extend the spec with more details as you progress.

Happy coding! :-)
